	<h1>Jamican Beef Stew</h1>

	<h2>my go-to recipe in combination with any kind of rice</h2>

	<p>I learnt how to prepare this stew form my mom, this stew had always been our sunday special back home in Nigeria. This is a stew rich in protien with the chunky amount of beef being used in its preparation and it also has a firey end tone taste of bell and black pepper. It is generally spicy and delicious, we usually combine it with white or brown rice.
	</p>

	<h3>Here are the ingredients for this amazing stew</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Beef</li>
		<li>Bell Pepper</li>
		<li>Soy sauce</li>
		<li>White onion</li>
		<li>Thyme</li>
		<li>Carrots</li>
		<li>Bay leaves</li>
		<li>Flour</li>
		<li>Olive oil</li>
		<li>Brown sugar</li>
		<li>Red wine vinegar</li>
		<li>Rice</li>
		<li>Allspice</li>
		<li>Steak sauce</li>
		<li>Tomatoes</li>

	</ul>

	<h4>Preparation steps</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Season beef with salt and pepper. Add beef to a pan and cook until well-browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Stir to loosen meat, continue to adding onions and carrot, reduce heat to medium and add habaneros, garlic and rum.</li>

		<li>Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes before adding chicken broth, allspice, brown sugar, red wine vinegar, tomatoes, soy sauce, and steak sauce.</li>

		<li>Continue cooking until meat is tear-apart tender when pireced with a fork, when stew is done, discard thyme springs and bay leaves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with green onions and serve hot with white or brown rice.</li>

		</ol>

		<p>I love this stew because of its high protien value and the firey hot sensation it gives.</p>
